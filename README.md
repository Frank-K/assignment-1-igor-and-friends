# Assignment #1

Implement the following two functions:

- getCollection: it should accept a callback, send a request to retrieve the full collection from your chosen API, wait until a response is received and callback with an array of objects, where each object is an item from the collection.  You are free to decide how many items are returned.

- getSortedCollection: it should accept a callback, retrieve the full collection, sort the collection using the criteria you think makes the most sense for its items and callback with a sorted array of objects.

Run using `node main.js`


Your project proposal should include following components:
* One or two paragraphs outlining the basic ideas about the web application you plan to build. What can users of your application expect to do?
* A brief description of how you plan on using your selected API as part of your web application.
* Answers to the questions above, planning how, if any, you can circumvent limitations you find in your selected API. For example, you may want to use an API with inadequate documentation. In this case you will need to do extra work up front to ensure that the API is really usable.
