# Assignment #1

Implement the following two functions:

- getCollection: it should accept a callback, send a request to retrieve the full collection from your chosen API, wait until a response is received and callback with an array of objects, where each object is an item from the collection.  You are free to decide how many items are returned.

- getSortedCollection: it should accept a callback, retrieve the full collection, sort the collection using the criteria you think makes the most sense for its items and callback with a sorted array of objects.

Run using `node main.js`
